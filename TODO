Hello Johan,
	I got PlayTab running both on my SGI and under MacPerl. It is quite
nice.  I have some suggestions for you to consider, though.  Some
(unbelievably primitive) parts of the world don't have easy access to A4
paper, and the first line or two gets cut off. Perhaps a switch to toggle
between A4 and 8.5"x11"? I don't know how much work that would be on your
part, so just take it as a suggestion.
	Eric
