PlayTab - Print chords of songs in a tabular fashion.

PlayTab is a perl program that generates PDF documents to print the
chords of songs. The output resembles (is influenced by) jazz grilles.

The input for playtab is plain ASCII. It contains the chords, the
division in bars, with optional annotations.

This is a rewrite of PlayTab 2.x, that focused on PostScript output.
