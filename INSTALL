INSTALLATION

  - Edit Makefile.PL (if needed)
  - Type 'perl Makefile.PL'
  - Type 'make'

    blib/script/playtab is the playtab program

  - Type 'make install' to install the program and the documentation
    on your system. This usually requires super user privileges.

EXAMPLES

  You will find several examples in directories 'hwbb' and 'misc'.
  HWBB stands for 'Herbie White Big Band', a big band started by
  Herman de Wit (knicknamed Herbie White). After his death the bigband
  renamed itself to 'Herbie White Big Band' to his memorial.

REQUIREMENTS

  - Perl 5 standard installation. Perl 5.005 is preferred.
  - If you cannot run Perl 5, but you do have Perl 4, let me know. I
    have an old version lying around that may still run under Perl 4.
